  Rain gardens can be a good solution to large, widespread drainage problems in
  a backyard. They can come in many styles and sizes. Larger and deeper rain
  gardens will treat more runoff, smaller and shallower rain gardens will treat
  less, but all properly functioning rain gardens will reduce polluted
  stormwater and help to recharge groundwater.
